    <section id="About" class="tab-content">
      <p>I grew up in Coeur d' Alene, Idaho for 18 years, and I went to college at the University of Montana in Missoula, MT. There, I studied Business-Finance for four years, and I met my husband, Phil.</p>
      <p>We moved to Denver, CO and we lived there for four years. I audited mortgage-backed securities, and then we moved to Seattle due to Phil pursuing a job at Eddie Bauer. I worked in commercial lending for a year at two different banks; however, I decided I needed a change from the financial industry. I got a job as a Product Data Specialist at C.C. Filson doing product data management and data analytics.</p>
      <p> I decided to pursue Web Development as my next professional chapter in life, and I am currently learning these skills during evenings at Code Fellows in Seattle.</p>
      <p>My hobbies include anything outdoors: primarily snowboarding, skiing, hiking, biking, camping, backpacking, wakeboarding, swimming, kayaking, etc. I also enjoy ballet, yoga, jogging, and living a healthy, fit lifestyle in general. Causes I care about inculde: the environment, equal rights, civil rights, and more.</p>
